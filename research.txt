Defining Mutations
The mutation policies are defined by means of mutation specific CRDs:

AssignMetadata - defines changes to the metadata section of a resource. The metadata section is sensitive to change, and hence has more limitations than other rules. Only labels and annotations can be modified
Assign - any change outside the metadata section
Each mutation CRD consists of three major sections:

Mutation scope - describes which resources are to be mutated
Mutation intent - the location of the mutation and the value to be assigned
Conditional - conditionals for performing the mutation

The match section is common to all mutators. It supports the following match criteria:

scope - the scope (Namespaced | Cluster) of the mutated resource
kinds - the resource kind, any of the elements listed
labelSelector - filters resources by resource labels listed
namespaces - list of allowed namespaces, only resources in listed namespaces will be mutated
namespaceSelector - filters resources by namespace selector
excludedNamespaces - list of excluded namespaces, resources in listed namespaces will not be mutated
name - the name of an object. If defined, it matches against objects with the specified name. Name also supports a prefix-based glob. For example, name: pod-* matches both pod-a and pod-b.
