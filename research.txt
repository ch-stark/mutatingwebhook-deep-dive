Defining Mutations
The mutation policies are defined by means of mutation specific CRDs:

AssignMetadata - defines changes to the metadata section of a resource. The metadata section is sensitive to change, and hence has more limitations than other rules. Only labels and annotations can be modified
Assign - any change outside the metadata section
Each mutation CRD consists of three major sections:

Mutation scope - describes which resources are to be mutated
Mutation intent - the location of the mutation and the value to be assigned
Conditional - conditionals for performing the mutation
